Cloud Database for Web Apps  with Django

    Types of databases
        Non-relational / document databases: MongoDB, Firebase, CouchDB, etc.
        Relational databases: MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.
        PostgreSQL: Popular open-source relational database that has a strong community and extension ecosystem. 
                    It's free and can be installed on your computer. It's also available as a service on Azure.

    Dockerfile
        ARG IMAGE=bullseye => The bullseye Docker image is based on Debian 11 Linux distribution.
        FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/${IMAGE} => The image from the MS Container Registry for development containers. 
        ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1 => Python output is unbuffered and sent directly to the console, which can be helpful when debugging applications.
        RUN apt-get update && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \ => used to prevent prompts from appearing during the installation process.
            && apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends postgresql-client \ =>installs the client package using apt-get, provides the psql command-line tool. 
            && apt-get clean -y && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* => clean up the package cache and remove unnecessary files to reduce the size of the Docker image.

    docker-compose.yaml
        services: => This defines two services - app and db.
            app:
                build:
                    context: ..
                    dockerfile: .devcontainer/Dockerfile
                    args:
                        IMAGE: python:3.11
                    volumes:
                        - ..:/workspace:cached
                    # Overrides default command so things don't shut down after the process ends.
                    command: sleep infinity
                    # Runs app on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
                    network_mode: service:db
                The app service builds the Docker image from the dockerfile using the Python version. 
                The volumes section mounts the parent directory (..) of the .devcontainer directory to the /workspace directory in the container, 
                allowing the local code changes to be reflected in the container. 
                The command section keeps the container running indefinitely, and network_mode section sets the network mode to be the same as the db service, 
                allowing them to communicate with each other.       
            db:
                image: postgres:latest
                restart: unless-stopped
                volumes:
                    - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
                environment:
                    POSTGRES_DB: postgres
                    POSTGRES_USER: admin
                    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: LocalPasswordOnly
                # Add "forwardPorts": ["5432"] to **devcontainer.json** to forward PostgreSQL locally.
                # (Adding the "ports" property to this file will not forward from a Codespace.)
            The db service uses the latest PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub,
            and volumes section mounts the postgres-data volume to the /var/lib/postgresql/data directory in the container. 
            The environment section sets the POSTGRES_DB, USER, PASSWORD env variables, which are used to create a new PostgreSQL database and user.
        volumes:
            postgres-data: => 
            A named volume called postgres-data, which can be used to persist data across container restarts. 
            Any data that is stored in the /var/lib/postgresql/data directory in the db service will be persisted in this volume.

    devcontainer.json -  is a configuration file used by VSC to define a development container for a project. 
        It specifies the development environment, including the Docker image to use, the container configuration, and the extensions to install in the container.
        
        Configuration needed to work with the Docker files:
            "name": "python-db-copilot",  => Sets the name of the development container to python-db-copilot.
            "dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yaml", => Specifies the Docker Compose file to use when building the dev container.
            "service": "app", => Specifies which service in the Docker Compose file to use as the main dev environment.
            "workspaceFolder": "/workspace", => Specifies the workspace folder in the container that will be mapped to the local 
                                                project directory.
            "forwardPorts": [5432], => Specifies which ports to forward from the container to the local machine. 
                                        In this case, it forwards port 5432, which is the default port for PostgreSQL.
            "portsAttributes": {
                "5432": {"label": "PostgreSQL port", "onAutoForward": "silent"}
            }, => Provides additional attributes for the forwarded port. In this case, a label to identify the forwarded port and
                    sets the onAutoForward attribute to "silent", which means that VSC Code will automatically forward the port without prompting the user.

        Installing extensions:
            "ms-python.python", => Official Python extension for VSC, it provides features such as linting, debugging, 
                                    code completion for Python.
            "ms-python.vscode-pylance", => An optional language server for Python that provides more advanced type 
                                        checking and autocomplete features.
            "charliermarsh.ruff", => This extension provides support for the Ruff database migration tool.
            "ms-python.black-formatter", =>  This extension provides support for the Black code formatter for Python.
            "mtxr.sqltools", => General-purpose SQL extension that provides features(syntax highlighting, code completion, and database management.)
            "mtxr.sqltools-driver-pg", => This is a PostgreSQL driver for the SQL Tools extension.
            "ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack" => Provides support for developing and deploying Node.js applications to Azure.

        Configuring SQLTools extension:
            "sqltools.connections": [
                {
                    "name": "Local database",
                    "driver": "PostgreSQL",
                    "server": "localhost",
                    "port": 5432,
                    "database": "postgres",
                    "username": "admin",
                    "password": "LocalPasswordOnly"
                }

        psycopg2: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. It allows Python to connect to and interact with PostgreSQL databases.
        
        python-dotenv: Allows you to load environment variables from a .env file into your Python application. This can be useful for storing sensitive information like database credentials or API keys.
        
        SQLAlchemy: ORM (object-relational mapping) library for Python. It allows you to interact with databases using Python code, and provides a high-level abstraction over SQL.
        
        mimesis: Python library for generating fake data. It can be useful for testing or populating a database with realistic-looking data.
        
        faker: Python library for generating fake data. It can also be useful for testing or populating a database with realistic-looking data.    

        pip install -r requirements.txt
